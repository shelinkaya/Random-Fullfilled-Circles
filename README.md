This repository has 3 different file. First one is random-fullfilled-circles.py. This project uses python turtle packages to generate randomly distributed/cut edges
circles. The size, radius, distance of the circles can be changed. The background color is white (which can be changed) and the circles are black. This file is able to
save the images as .svg and .json file. 

If you want to make circles' color as random RGB colors, you can use random-fullfilled-circles_with_random_colors.py 

Third file is matlab code, segment_label.m, which can convert randomly distributed white circles with black background to randomly gray scale RGB circles.
